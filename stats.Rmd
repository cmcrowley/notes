# On probability

- Conditional probability

\begin{equation}
  P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} 
\end{equation}

  - Independence
  If the conditional probability of A|B equals the unconditional probability of A then A is independent of B. 
$$ P(A|B)=P(A) \implies P(A\cap B) = P(A)P(B) $$
  Note that the second equation results from multiplying both sides of \ref{cp}
  
- Unconditional probability
$$ P(A)=P(A|B) + P(A | not B) $$


# On randomness, probability distributions
### EMD Chapter 4

- "Unfortunately, classical nonparametric approaches makei t much harder to draw quantitative conclusions from data (rather than simply rejecting or failing to reject null hypotheses about differences between groups")
- Stochastic models don't just treat variability as a nuisance, but actually tells us something about processes. For ex., cenusus counts that follow a negative binomial distribution tell us there is some form of environmental variation or aggregative response among individuals that we haven't taken into account. (Shaw and Dobson, 1995)
- Variability feeds back to change the mean behavior of ecological systems
  - Damselfish system (ch. 2), the number of recruits in any given cohort is the number of settlers surviving density-dependent mortality, but the average number of recruits is lower than expected from an average-sized cohort of settlers because large cohorts suffer disproportionately high mortality and contribute relatively little to the average. 
  -   Q: then where does the 'expected' value of recruits come from?
    - follows from Jensen's inequality (ruel and Ayres, 1999; Inouye, 2005)
